            <h2 id="missioninner">Our mission is to bring a fun and competitive esports league to the twin cities. If there is a game that you like to play we will strive to bring a community together to play. By creating your own partnerships with other players, you'll be able to find out who will play best with you.</h2>

            <h1>Goals for my site</h1>
            <h2>My first goal is to create a seperate web page for each of the different games people like to play nowadays.</h2>
            <div style="height: 5px;"></div>
            <h2>My second goal is to get all of my content areas in the correct place on the main page.</h2>
            <div style="height: 5px;"></div>
            <h2>My third goal is to make the site interactive with the user by making the front panel of the site rotate.</h2>

            <h1>Page content</h1>
            <div style="height: 20px;"></div>
            <h2>The main page of my site is now a collage of the different information my site has to offer. I'm hoping to make the home page interactive, allowing the user to direct themselves where they need to go. Examples of these items would be different games like Rocket League, Fortnite, Call of Duty, etc. The other items would bring the user to information about the site.</h2>

            <h1>Target Audience</h1>
            <h2>My target age would be people both boy and girl, between 16-30 years old. I put it at this because this is a very common age range for people that typically play video games. End users of this website will have had a fun experience playing video games with their friends or with other people on the site.</h2>

            <h1 id="sitetop">Site inspiration</h1>
            <h2 id="siteinner">I chose this website because I like the way that the front panel cycles through different images, this would be a really good element to implement if I have many images I want on the front page but not enough space. The website in general is very simple, it has two pages on the start with hot links to different sub parts of the website. I'm going to do this because I like the empty look with hot links. I think that this would also work really well for the actual contenmt I hope to put in.</h2>
